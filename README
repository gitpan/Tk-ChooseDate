Tk-ChooseDate version 0.4
=========================

ChooseDate is a popup calendar widget used for choosing dates. It
has support for using dates prior to 1970 - something with no
other Tk popup calendar does at time of writing.

This widget uses a Tk::Canvas to ensure a crisp looking widget with
many color options. The authors opinion is that it is the best
calendar-like widget for Perl/Tk - with similar functionality of
DateEntry - but much more user friendly as dates can be chosen
quickly and easily.

Various languages are supported since v0.4.
